# Libraries

## Updating libraries

Some of the libraries in this folder can be updated semi-automatically by invoking:

```sh
cd ./FreshRSS/lib/
composer update --no-autoloader
```

Remember to proof-read the changes, preserve possible local patches, delete irrelevant files, and test before committing.
