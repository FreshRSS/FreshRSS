## Report a bug

You found a bug? Don’t panic, here are some steps to report it easily:

1. Search for it on [the bug tracker](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues) (don’t forget to use the search bar).
2. If you find a similar bug, don’t hesitate to post a comment to add more importance to the related ticket.
3. If you didn’t find it, [open a new ticket](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues/new).

If you have to create a new ticket, try to apply the following advices:

- Give an explicit title to the ticket so it will be easier to find it later.
- Be as exhaustive as possible in the description: what did you do? What is the bug? What are the steps to reproduce the bug?
- We also need some information:
    + Your FreshRSS version (on about page or `constants.php` file)
    + Your server configuration: type of hosting, PHP version
    + Your storage system (MySQL / MariaDB or SQLite)
    + If possible, the related logs (PHP logs and FreshRSS logs under `data/users/your_user/log.txt`)

You have great ideas, yes! Don't be shy and open [a new ticket](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues/new) on our bug tracker to ask if we can implement it. The greatest ideas often come from the shyest suggestions!

If your idea is nice, we’ll have a look at it.

## Contribute to internationalization (i18n)

If you want to improve internationalization, please open a new ticket first and follow indications from « Fix a bug » section.

Translations are present in the subdirectories of `./app/i18n/`.

We are working on a better way to handle internationalization but don’t hesitate to suggest any idea!
