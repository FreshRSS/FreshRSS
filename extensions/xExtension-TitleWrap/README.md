# TitleWrap extension

FreshRSS extension which changes how article titles are being displayed. Instead of truncating a title when it overflows the display area,
this extension applies a line-wrap to long article titles.

To use it, upload this directory in your `./extensions` directory and enable it on the extension panel in FreshRSS. If you need more control, use the xExtension-CustomCSS instead to specify your own css rules.

The CSS code (since 0.3 legacy) used to wrap long titles was originally [proposed](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues/2344) by â‚£rans de Jonge.

## Changelog

- 0.3 ready for FreshRSS 1.23.2-dev (April 2023) / upcoming 1.24.0
- 0.1 initial version
