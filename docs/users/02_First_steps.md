Learning how to handle a new application is not always easy. We build FreshRSS to be intuitive, but you will need some guidance to get your hand on it.

This section guides you to the pages you need as a new comer.

[After installing the application](../admins/02_Installation.md), the first step is to add some feeds. You have a few options:

1. [Add a feed manually](04_Subscriptions.md#adding-a-feed)
2. [Import an OPML or JSON file](04_Subscriptions.md#import-and-export)
3. [Use the bookmarklet](04_Subscriptions.md#use-bookmarklet)
4. [Firefox integration](04_Subscriptions.md#firefox-subscription-service)

Once you have added your feeds to FreshRSS, it is time to read them. You have access to three reading modes:

1. [The normal view](03_Main_view.md#normal-view) which allows you to display and read quickly new articles
2. [The global view](03_Main_view.md#global-view) which allows you to see in one glance the status of your feeds
3. [The reader view](03_Main_view.md#reader-view) which allows you to have a nice reading experience.

Now that you know the basic usages, it is time to configure FreshRSS to improve your reading experience. It has a lot of options, so play with them to find your perfect configuration. However, here is few resources to help you:

* [Organize your feeds in categories](04_Subscriptions.md#feed-management)
* [Change the home page](05_Configuration.md#changing-the-view)
* [Choose the reading options](05_Configuration.md#reading-options)
* [Refresh feeds](03_Main_view.md#refreshing-feeds)
* [Filter articles](03_Main_view.md#filtering-articles) for a fast access to a selection
* [Search an article](03_Main_view.md#searching-articles) published some time ago
* [Access your feeds on a mobile device](06_Mobile_access.md)
* [Add some extensions](https://github.com/FreshRSS/Extensions)
* [Frequently asked questions](07_Frequently_Asked_Questions.md)
