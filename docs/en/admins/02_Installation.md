# Server requirements

FreshRSS is a web application. This means you’ll need a web server to run it. FreshRSS requirements are really low, so it could run on most shared host servers.

You need to verify that your server can run FreshRSS before installing it. If your server has the proper requirements and FreshRSS does not work, please contact us to find a solution.

| Software    | Recommended      | Works also with               |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Web server  | **Apache 2**     | Nginx                         |
| PHP         | **PHP 5.5+**     | PHP 5.3.8+                    |
| PHP modules | Required: libxml, cURL, PDO_MySQL, PCRE and ctype. \\ Required (32-bit only): GMP \\Recommanded: JSON, Zlib, mbstring, iconv, ZipArchive | |

## Important notice

FreshRSS **CAN** work with PHP 5.3.8+. To do so, we are using specific functions available in the [''password_compat'' library](https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat#requirements) for the form authentication.


# Getting the appropriate version of FreshRSS

FreshRSS has three different releases or branches. Each branch has its own release frequency. So it is better if you spend some time to understand the purpose of each release.

## Stable release

[Download](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/archive/master.zip)

This release is done when we consider that our goal concerning the new features and the stability is reached. It could happen that we make two releases in a really short time if we have a really good coding pace. In reality, we are all working on our spare time, so we release every few months. But this version is really stable, tested thoroughly and you should not face any major bugs.

## Development release

[Download](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/archive/dev.zip)

As its name suggests, it is the working release for developers. **This release is unstable!** If you want to keep track of enhancements on a daily basis, you can use it. But keep in mind that you need to follow the branch activity on Github (via [the branch RSS feed](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/commits/dev.atom) for instance). Some say that the main developers use it on a daily basis without problem. They may know what they are doing…

# Apache installation

This is an example Apache virtual hosts configuration file. It covers HTTP and HTTPS configuration.

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
	DocumentRoot /var/www/html/

	#Default site...

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.default.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.default.log vhost_combined
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName rss.example.net
	DocumentRoot /path/to/FreshRSS/p/

	<Directory /path/to/FreshRSS/p>
		AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Limit
		Require all granted
	</Directory>

	ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/freshrss_error.log
	CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/freshrss_access.log combined

	AllowEncodedSlashes On
</VirtualHost>

<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
	<VirtualHost *:443>
		ServerName rss.example.net
		DocumentRoot /path/to/FreshRSS/p/

		<Directory /path/to/FreshRSS/p>
			AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Limit
			Require all granted
		</Directory>

		ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/freshrss_error.log
		CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/freshrss_access.log combined

		<IfModule mod_http2.c>
			Protocols h2 http/1.1
		</IfModule>

		# For the API
		AllowEncodedSlashes On

		SSLEngine on
		SSLCompression off
		SSLCertificateFile /path/to/server.crt
		SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/server.key
		# Additional SSL configuration, e.g. with LetsEncrypt
	</VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
```

# Nginx installation

This is an example nginx configuration file. It covers HTTP, HTTP, and php-fpm configuration.

_You can find simpler config file but they may be incompatible with FreshRSS API._

```
server {
	listen 80;
	listen 443 ssl;

	# HTTPS configuration
	ssl on;
	ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/server.crt;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/server.key;

	# your server’s URL(s)
	server_name rss.example.net;

	# the folder p of your FreshRSS installation
	root /srv/FreshRSS/p/;

	index index.php index.html index.htm;

	# nginx log files
	access_log /var/log/nginx/rss.access.log;
	error_log /var/log/nginx/rss.error.log;

	# php files handling
	# this regex is mandatory because of the API
	location ~ ^.+?\.php(/.*)?$ {
		fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
		fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.*)$;
		# By default, the variable PATH_INFO is not set under PHP-FPM
		# But FreshRSS API greader.php need it. If you have a “Bad Request” error, double check this var!
		fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
		include fastcgi_params;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
	}

	location / {
		try_files $uri $uri/ index.php;
	}
}
```

# Security

Make sure to expose only the `./p/` folder on the web, the other directories contain personal and sensitive data. 
See the Apache and nginx config examples above.
