# Service Worker

The Service Worker is generated by [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) according to `workbox-config.js`. Changes should be made to the `workbox-config.js` ([parameters](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-build#.generateSW)) and after changes, you should run

````bash
workbox generateSW workbox-config.js
````

to regenerate the Service Worker script to test locally.
