# Writing a new theme

**Note: Currently personal themes are not officially supported and may be overwritten when updating. Be sure to keep backups!**

**As of writing (02-02-2021), support for themes as extensions is under development.**

The easiest way to create a theme is by copying and modifying the base theme (or another of the pre-installed themes). The base theme can be found in [/p/themes/base-theme](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/tree/master/p/themes/base-theme). Themes require:
- a **metadata.json** file to describe the theme.
- a **loader.gif** file to use as a loading icon (assuming .loading's background has not been overridden)
- an **icons** folder containing .svg, .ico, and .png files to override existing icons
- a **thumbs** folder containing a file, **original.png** that will be used as the preview for the theme

"_template.css" is normally added to the metadata file as a fallback for missing aspects. The file is taken from the base theme. If submitting a pull request for a theme, please know that [pull request themes must include this file.](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/pull/2938#issuecomment-624085450)

## RTL Support

RTL (right-to-left) support for languages such as Hebrew and Arabic is handled through CSSJanus. To generate an RTL CSS file from your standard file, use `make rtl`. Be sure to commit the resulting file (filename.rtl.css).

# Overriding icons

To replace the default icons, add an "icons" folder to your theme's folder. Use files with the same name as the default icon to override them. 

# Template file

metadata.json
```
{
  "name": "Theme name",
  "author": "Theme author",
  "description": "Theme description",
  "version": 0.1,
  "files": ["_template.css", "file1.css", "file2.css"]
}
```

An example of a css theme file can be found at [/p/themes/base-theme/base.css](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/blob/master/p/themes/base-theme/base.css)
