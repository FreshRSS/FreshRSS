# FreshRSS
FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed agregator like [Leed](http://projet.idleman.fr/leed/) or [Kriss Feed](http://tontof.net/kriss/feed/).

It is at the same time light-weight, easy to work with, powerful and customizable.

It is a multi-user application with an anonymous reading mode.

# Installation
1. Get FreshRSS with git or [by downloading the archive](https://github.com/marienfressinaud/FreshRSS/archive/master.zip)
2. Dump the application on your server (expose only the `./p/` folder)
3. Add write access on `./data/` folder to the webserver user
4. Access FreshRSS with your browser and follow the installation process
5. Every thing should be working :) If you encounter any problem, feel free to contact me.

# Access control
It is needed for the multi-user mode to limit access to FreshRSS. You can:
* use form authentication (need JavaScript and PHP 5.3.7+, works with some PHP 5.3.3+)
* use [Mozilla Persona](https://login.persona.org/about) authentication included in FreshRSS
* use HTTP authentication supported by your web server
	* See [Apache documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/howto/auth.html)
		* In that case, create a `./p/i/.htaccess` file with a matching `.htpasswd` file.

# Automatic feed update
* You can add a Cron job to launch the update script.
Check the Cron documentation related to your distribution ([Debian/Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto), [Red Hat/Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Administration_Guide_Draft/Cron), [Slackware](http://docs.slackware.com/fr:slackbook:process_control?#cron), [Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Cron), [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cron)…).
It’s a good idea to use the web server user .
For example, if you want to run the script every hour:

```
7 * * * * php /chemin/vers/FreshRSS/app/actualize_script.php > /tmp/FreshRSS.log 2>&1
```

# Advices
* For a better security, expose only the `./p/` folder on the web.
	* Be aware that the `./data/` folder contain all personal data, so it is a bad idea to expose it.
* The `./constants.php` file define access to application folder. If you want to customize your installation, every thing happens here.
* If you encounter some problem, logs are accessibles from the interface or manually in `./data/log/*.log` files.

# Backup
* You need to keep `./data/config.php`, `./data/*_user.php` and `./data/persona/` files
* You can export your feed list in OPML format from FreshRSS
* To save articles, you can use [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net) or MySQL tools:

```bash
mysqldump -u user -p --databases freshrss > freshrss.sql
```
