# FreshRSS
FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator like [Leed](https://github.com/LeedRSS/Leed) or [Kriss Feed](https://tontof.net/kriss/feed/).

It is lightweight, easy to work with, powerful, and customizable.

It is a multi-user application with an anonymous reading mode. It supports custom tags.
There is an API for (mobile) clients, and a [Command-Line Interface](cli/README.md).

Thanks to the [WebSub](https://www.w3.org/TR/websub/) standard (formerly [PubSubHubbub](https://github.com/pubsubhubbub/PubSubHubbub)),
FreshRSS is able to receive instant push notifications from compatible sources, such as [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), [Friendica](https://friendi.ca), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/), Blogger, FeedBurner, etc.

Finally, it supports [extensions](#extensions) for further tuning.

Feature requests, bug reports, and other contributions are welcome. The best way to contribute is to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues).
We are a friendly community.

# [Installation](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/admins/03_Installation.html)

## Automated install
* [![Docker](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/horizontal.png)](./Docker/)
* [![YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=freshrss)
* [![Cloudron](https://cloudron.io/img/button.svg)](https://cloudron.io/button.html?app=org.freshrss.cloudronapp)

## Manual install
1. Get FreshRSS with git or [by downloading the archive](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/archive/master.zip)
2. Put the application somewhere on your server (expose only the `./p/` folder to the Web)
3. Add write access to the `./data/` folder for the webserver user
4. Access FreshRSS with your browser and follow the installation process
	* or use the [Command-Line Interface](cli/README.md)
5. Everything should be working :) If you encounter any problems, feel free to [contact us](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/issues).
6. Advanced configuration settings can be found in [config.default.php](config.default.php) and modified in `data/config.php`.
7. When using Apache, enable [`AllowEncodedSlashes`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/core.html#allowencodedslashes) for better compatibility with mobile clients.

More detailed information about installation and server configuration can be found in [our documentation](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/admins/03_Installation.html).

## Advice
* For better security, expose only the `./p/` folder to the Web.
	* Be aware that the `./data/` folder contains all personal data, so it is a bad idea to expose it.
* The `./constants.php` file defines access to the application folder. If you want to customize your installation, look here first.
* If you encounter any problem, logs are accessible from the interface or manually in `./data/users/*/log*.txt` files.
	* The special folder `./data/users/_/` contains the part of the logs that are shared by all users.


# F.A.Q.:
* The date and time in the right-hand column is the date declared by the feed, not the time at which the article was received by FreshRSS, and it is not used for sorting.
	* In particular, when importing a new feed, all of its articles will appear at the top of the feed list regardless of their declared date.


# Extensions
FreshRSS supports further customizations by adding extensions on top of its core functionality.
See the [repository dedicated to those extensions](https://github.com/FreshRSS/Extensions).


# APIs & native apps

FreshRSS supports access from mobile / native apps for Linux, Android, iOS, and OS X, via two distinct APIs:
[Google Reader API](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/users/06_Mobile_access.html) (best),
and [Fever API](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/users/06_Fever_API.html) (limited features and less efficient).
